          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Regional climate models project average summer highs rising 1.5°F by 2030, 3.2°F by 2040, and over 5°F by 2055.
            Heat advisories will occur more frequently, making high-efficiency cooling and radiant barriers essential.
            Precipitation will remain sporadic yet intense—monsoon bursts bring localized flooding even in FEMA Zone X areas.
            Meanwhile, drought conditions elevate wildfire fuel concerns along preserved desert corridors north of Silverstone
            Ranch.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Use these benchmarks when planning upgrades. Investing in reflective roofing, drip irrigation, and backup power
            supplies now reduces maintenance costs later and keeps insurance premiums manageable as carriers re-price climate
            exposure.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Insurance Cost Projections</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Insurance carriers adjust rates annually based on regional climate data. Expect heat- and wind-related premiums to
            rise 3–6% per year unless mitigation projects are documented. Flood riders remain optional for most Silverstone
            parcels, yet homeowners who install smart leak detectors and submit photos of grading improvements often secure
            preferred rates. Review policies at renewal and request replacement-cost endorsements covering roofs, HVAC
            systems, and solar installations.
