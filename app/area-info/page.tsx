            Paiute tribal land to the north, preserving open desert vistas and cooler evening temperatures.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            Residents leverage a mix of personal vehicles, express buses, and rideshare hubs to navigate Las Vegas. The
            Centennial Hills Transit Center—less than ten minutes away—offers park-and-ride convenience with routes to the
            Strip and Downtown. RideShare staging zones outside the guard gate streamline airport transfers, while planned
            roadway improvements along Grand Montecito Parkway will widen lanes and add protected bike shoulders by 2027.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Obtaining a residential decal from the guard gate speeds re-entry during peak hours. Dr. Jan Duffy provides a
            relocation checklist covering DMV registration, express bus schedules, and smart-route suggestions to avoid
            congestion during large-scale city events.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            Centennial Hills continues to attract investment. The City of Las Vegas has allocated funds for a new regional
            library branch, expanded fire station coverage, and upgrades to Floyd Lamb Park including an amphitheater and
            enhanced trail lighting. Commercial permits filed for Skye Canyon Marketplace phase two will introduce upscale
            dining, boutique fitness, and a co-working lounge—amenities that complement Silverstone lifestyle priorities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Monitoring city council agendas keeps residents informed about road projects, school rezoning considerations, and
            any proposals touching the dormant golf course parcels. Dr. Duffy circulates quarterly development briefs to
            clients, helping buyers and sellers anticipate how improvements may influence property values.

              <p className="mt-3">
                Elevated topography and distance from major resorts keep ambient noise low. Occasional aircraft activity stems
                from North Las Vegas Airport training flights, but guard gates and landscaped buffers maintain a quiet
                environment.
