              The Silverstone golf course has been closed since 2015. In May 2025 it changed hands at auction, but no
              redevelopment plan has been announced. Use this guide to understand the verified history, evaluate realistic
              scenarios, and incorporate the latest intel into your home valuation, offer strategy, and landscaping plans.

              Buyers and homeowners alike should assume the course may remain dormant indefinitely while keeping an eye on

              The 2015 closure triggered more than a dozen lawsuits, including allegations of covenant violations and
              maintenance failures. Between 2016 and 2020 the property cycled through receiverships, leaving sprinklers dry
              and fairways dormant. When the 2021 fire destroyed the clubhouse, insurance proceeds became entangled in the
              bankruptcy estate. The 2025 auction finally cleared the decks, but liens and development covenants remain.
              Understanding this chronology helps you explain the risk profile to lenders, appraisers, and buyers.

              <span className="font-semibold text-slate-900">Restoration Attempt:</span> Requires rebuilding irrigation,
              clubhouse facilities, and staffing operations. Expect multi-year permitting, environmental reviews, and a
              special assessment unless private capital funds the project. Buyers should not rely on this scenario when

              the course for residential lots or mixed-use amenities. Super-majority HOA approval is challenging; previous
              attempts in 2017 and 2019 stalled amid homeowner opposition. If a formal proposal surfaces, expect a wave of

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700">
              Homes that back the dormant course benefit from thoughtful design updates. Consider the following strategies:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
              <li>Install layered desert landscaping with native trees to frame views and create privacy without blocking mountain sightlines.</li>
              <li>Use rock swales and permeable hardscape to manage stormwater runoff during monsoon bursts.</li>
              <li>Incorporate low-voltage lighting and seating areas to create usable outdoor rooms even without manicured fairways.</li>
              <li>Consult HOA architectural guidelines before constructing fencing, shade structures, or retaining walls.</li>

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Lenders evaluate golf-adjacent properties differently when fairways are dormant. Strengthen your loan file by
              providing current photos, disclosure summaries, and landscaping budgets. Arrange appraisal gap reserves or
              buydown credits in advance so you can counter lower valuations without delaying closing. Dr. Duffy coordinates
              lender briefings to ensure underwriting teams understand Silverstone’s context before issuing commitments.

            <p className="text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Homes bordering open land should review liability coverage for trespass, debris, and irrigation runoff. Request
              umbrella policies and examine wildfire endorsements. Buyers who demonstrate proactive maintenance—defensible
              space, irrigation checks, security lighting—often secure better rates. Keep insurer correspondence on file for
              future resale discussions.
