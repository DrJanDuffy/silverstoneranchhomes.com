            Buying in Silverstone Ranch demands a refined approach—balancing guard-gated HOA requirements, the dormant golf

            Transactions typically progress over 30–45 days. Buyers should aim for the following milestones:

          <ol className="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700 list-decimal list-inside bg-white rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
            <li>Week 1: Pre-approval, strategy session, property shortlist.</li>
            <li>Week 2: Offer submission, negotiations, earnest money deposit.</li>
            <li>Week 3: Inspection marathon (general, roof, HVAC, sewer), appraisal ordered.</li>
            <li>Week 4: Loan conditions, HOA document review, repair negotiations.</li>
            <li>Week 5: Final walkthrough, closing disclosure, recording, move-in coordination.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Relocation buyers arriving from California, Arizona, and military assignments often compress this timeline into
            a single extended trip. Dr. Duffy coordinates private previews and digital walk-throughs so you can select and
            secure a property before boarding your return flight.

            Silverstone Ranch is governed by a master association layered with sub-associations such as The Palms, Tuscany,

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Comparing Silverstone to Neighboring Communities</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Understanding how Silverstone stacks up against nearby master plans sharpens your offer strategy. Providence
            provides newer construction but lacks guard gates, while Skye Canyon offers an urban village feel with fewer
            mature trees and smaller lot sizes. Summerlin North commands higher HOA dues and similar amenities but carries a
            premium for brand recognition. By aggregating this data, Dr. Duffy helps you calibrate price negotiations,
            repair allowances, and long-term appreciation expectations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Buyers prioritizing school zoning, park access, and guard-gated security consistently lean toward Silverstone.
            Investors seeking furnished rental returns compare Pinehurst townhomes to Skye Canyon’s loft products; Silverstone
            wins on occupancy, while Skye Canyon offers more contemporary architecture. Use these insights to justify offer
            terms when sellers question pricing variances.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning</h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Even with thorough due diligence, unexpected issues can surface. Build resilience into your escrow timeline by
            securing backup lenders, maintaining a reserve for post-inspection repairs, and confirming insurance coverage
            before waiving contingencies. If the appraisal returns below contract price, Dr. Duffy prepares reconsiderations
            backed by private-sale comps and renovation receipts. If inspections reveal defects, lean on vendor estimates to
            negotiate credits without derailing timelines.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Keep a communication log documenting all HOA interactions, gate access requests, and seller disclosures. This
            record protects you during negotiations and informs future resale conversations. In addition, review the golf
            course status summary and environmental risk guide with your lender so underwriting teams understand Silverstone’s
            unique landscape.

            members, and invites to neighborhood events so you build relationships quickly. Her concierge team coordinates
