            executed a four-week transformation: drought-tolerant landscaping created layered privacy, twilight photography
            captured romantic lighting, and a disclosure packet educated prospects on auction outcomes and future scenarios. The
            home launched on a Thursday, hosted a relocation preview Friday, and collected five offers by Monday. The winning
            contract closed 2.7% above list with a rent-back that aligned with the sellers’ Summerlin build timeline.

            Key takeaways included the power of transparent communication, targeted staging investments, and a marketing calendar
            that stacked momentum events. Sellers praised the concierge approach for eliminating stress, while buyers appreciated
            the clarity around golf course status. This playbook now guides similar listings across Silverstone, ensuring dormant
            fairway homes remain competitive.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            When an out-of-state family needed to liquidate a Silverlake home, Dr. Duffy quarterbacked every detail. Estate sale
            partners cataloged belongings, a digital document vault captured signatures across three time zones, and weekly video
            updates kept heirs aligned. Pre-list inspections resolved deferred maintenance, while staging highlighted single-story
            living and proximity to parks. Within ten days the property attracted three financed offers and one cash bid; the family
            selected a buyer willing to accommodate a 30-day rent-back so personal items could be shipped gradually. net proceeds
            exceeded expectations by $34,000 compared to initial valuations.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The success stemmed from organizational rigor and empathy. By managing logistics—including utility transfers, donation
            pickups, and HOA communications—Dr. Duffy allowed the family to focus on memorial planning while trusting the sale was
            handled professionally.
