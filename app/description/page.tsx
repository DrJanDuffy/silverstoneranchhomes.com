          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Silverstone Ranch rose from the desert between 2003 and 2008, transforming 27 holes of rolling fairways into one of
            Centennial Hills’ most beloved guard-gated enclaves. The community stretches along the foothills north of the 215
            Beltway, where the Spring and Sheep Mountain ranges create a dramatic skyline and cooler evening breezes. Every
            approach to Silverstone is intentional: palm-lined boulevards, tree canopies, and meticulously maintained xeriscape
            plantings guide residents to a staffed gatehouse that sets the tone for a secure yet welcoming neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Today, Silverstone balances its golf-course origins with a forward-looking lifestyle. Walking and biking paths trace
            the former fairways, connecting nine micro-neighborhoods to a six-acre community park, lighted basketball courts,
            and picnic lawns. With Downtown Summerlin, the medical district, and national recreation areas minutes away,
            homeowners enjoy suburban calm without sacrificing convenience. Dr. Jan Duffy narrates this story for clients by
            weaving market analytics, HOA history, and neighborhood anecdotes into every tour.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The Palms anchors Silverstone with estate-style residences ranging from 2,800 to over 4,000 square feet. Deep lot
              setbacks create dramatic driveways, and private courtyards extend interior living to the outdoors. Many homes
              feature casitas and multi-generational suites, appealing to households seeking flexible space. Residents enjoy a
              short stroll to the community park and appreciate the privacy afforded by single-access entry and professional
              landscaping that wraps every cul-de-sac.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Pinehurst blends lock-and-leave convenience with Silverstone charm. Two-story townhomes measure 1,345 to 2,015 square
              feet and include attached two-car garages, generous storage, and covered patios positioned to capture sunrise and
              sunset views. Maintenance is HOA-managed, making Pinehurst a favorite among medical professionals from nearby
              Centennial Hills Hospital and snowbirds who want an easy, low-maintenance base in Las Vegas.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Silverlake is synonymous with single-story living. Homes measure 2,025 to 2,825 square feet and sit on lots up to a
              quarter acre, plenty of space for pools, outdoor kitchens, and putting greens. Interiors emphasize open-concept
              great rooms, split-bedroom configurations, and oversize garages that easily accommodate desert toys or workshops.
              The neighborhood sells quickly thanks to limited single-story supply across Las Vegas.

              Positioned along the former golf course, the Princeville Collection offers the community’s most dramatic curb
              appeal. Two-story homes boast grand staircases, lofts that transition into game rooms or offices, and panoramic
              windows framing mountain vistas. Three-car garages and generous side yards appeal to car enthusiasts and families
              with recreational vehicles. Even with the course dormant, the wide sightlines remain a major draw for buyers.

              These non-gated villages provide approachable entry points into Silverstone while retaining the signature
              landscaping, architectural diversity, and neighborly energy the community is known for. Streets meander around
              pocket parks and green space, creating an inviting environment for evening walks, dog-friendly meetups, and
              seasonal block parties. Buyers appreciate the balance of value, space, and community engagement found in these
              neighborhoods.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Silverstone homes blend Mediterranean and contemporary influences. Expect stucco exteriors, stacked-stone accents,
            wrought-iron balconies, and clay tile roofs that complement the desert palette. Inside, soaring ceilings, transom
            windows, and engineered hardwood or travertine floors create a sophisticated yet livable environment. Great rooms
            connect seamlessly to kitchens with oversized islands, professional appliance packages, and walk-in pantries. Owner
            suites rival resort retreats with spa-like baths, frameless showers, soaking tubs, and custom closets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Buyers also value the thoughtful storage solutions hidden throughout: drop zones near garages, built-in shelving in
            lofts, and climate-controlled wine closets in select plans. Smart-home enhancements—Nest thermostats, integrated
            security, and EV-ready outlets—are increasingly common, supporting modern lifestyles without compromising the
            community’s timeless aesthetic.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Living in Silverstone means embracing Southern Nevada’s sunshine. Many homes feature multi-panel sliders that erase
            the line between great rooms and covered patios. Outdoor kitchens, fire pits, misting systems, and pebble-finish
            pools turn backyards into year-round entertainment zones. Desert-friendly plant palettes—agaves, rosemary, and dwarf
            palms—deliver color and texture while keeping water usage in check. For homes bordering dormant fairways, residents
            invest in creative landscaping: raised planters, privacy hedges, and art installations that elevate the view.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Community amenities complement private outdoor spaces. The six-acre park hosts weekend soccer games, yoga classes,
            and food truck gatherings. Lighted basketball and tennis courts stay active into the evening thanks to soft desert
            breezes. Families often bike from neighborhood to neighborhood, connecting with friends along the way. Silverstone is
            designed for movement, wellness, and connection.

              board overflows with babysitter recommendations, gardening clubs, and philanthropic initiatives. Dr. Duffy herself

            November 2025 market performance underscores Silverstone’s desirability. Median sale price sits at $685,000—up 5.2%
            year-over-year—while price per square foot averages $284. Renovated single-story homes command an 8% premium over
            two-story counterparts due to limited supply. Inventory remains tight with 18 active listings, and well-presented
            homes secure offers in under two weeks. Buyers appreciate the guard-gated lifestyle, established landscaping, and
            proximity to top-ranked schools like O’Roarke Elementary, Cadwallader Middle, and Arbor View High.
